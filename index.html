            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 450F. Start the recipe when the oven is ready. Read the entire recipe card. Sprinkle both sides of the dough with flour. On a baking sheet (use 2 baking sheets for 4 portions), divide the dough into two equal pieces (four pieces for 4 portions) and stretch each piece into a rough circle shape. Let the dough rest in a warm place for 8-10 min.</li>
                <li>While dough rests, wash and dry all produce. Thinly slice shallot.</li>
                <li>In a large non-stick pan, heat 2 tsp oil (double for 4 portions) over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add shallots and sausage. Cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, for 5 min, until the pork is no longer pink.**Off heat, stir pesto into sausage mixture.</li>
                <li>Re-stretch each piece of dough into an 8-inch circle.*Add pesto pork mixture to one half of each dough circle, then sprinkle mozzarella over top. Fold the other half of each dough circle over top of filling, then crimp edges to seal. Lightly brush 1 tsp oil over each calzone. Bake on the middle rack of oven for 12-14 min, until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Cut grape tomatoes in half. In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, 1/4 tsp sugar and 1 1/2 tbsp oil (double both for 4 portions). Season with salt and pepper. Add baby spinach and tomatoes. Toss to coat. Serve calzones with salad alongside. Sprinkle feta cheese over the salad. Enjoy!</li>
